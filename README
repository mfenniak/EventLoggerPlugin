EventLoggerPlugin is a server-side plugin for Source-engine dedicated servers.
The plugin logs all game events into a PostgreSQL database for later analysis.

Compilation (Windows):

    * Open EventLoggerPlugin.sln with Visual Studio 2009.

    * Define DB_CONNECT_STR in EventLoggerPlugin.cpp.

    * Build solution.


Installation (Windows):

    * In your team fortress 2 steamapps directory (eg.
      D:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\mfenniak\team fortress 2\tf), create
      a the directories "addons", "addons\eventloggerplugin", and 
      "Addons\eventloggerplugin\bin".

    * Write a file in "addons" called "eventloggerplugin.vdf" containing:

        "Plugin"
        {
                "file"	"..\tf\addons\eventloggerplugin\bin\server.dll"
        }

    * Copy [Debug|Release]\server.dll into the eventloggerplugin\bin folder.

    * Copy all the .dll files from a PostgreSQL installation into the "bin"
      folder as well, including libpq.dll and other needed libraries.


Compilation (Linux):

    * Bwuahahaha.  The top-level Makefile works, but uses many hard-coded
      paths.  Good luck.
